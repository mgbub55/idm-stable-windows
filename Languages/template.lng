//This template should be used to translate Internet Download Manager 
//to foreign languages.

//You can save translation file in UTF-8 format if your language does not support ASCII code page. 
//IDM can use UTF-8 format translations only starting from 6.32 version. 
//Please don't save to UTF-8 if ASCII is supported because older IDM versions will not be able to load your translation

//All template files should be named using idm_*.lng name pattern convention. 
//Please place the abbreviated language name (de, en, es, fr, :) 
//instead of the asterisk. For example: idm_de.lng or idm_fr.lng

//The first string inside the template should be lang=ID Name
//where Name - the full name of the language (on English),
//ID - hex number that defines Windows API value of the language.
//Here are sample primary language IDs:
//0x06 DANISH
//0x0b FINNISH
//0x0c FRENCH
//0x07 GERMAN
//0x10 ITALIAN
//0x11 JAPANESE
//0x0a SPANISH
//0x1d SWEDISH

//The strings from second to fourth may contain file names of translated tips, 
//help and tutorial files. If these strings are absent, 
//or files cannot be found in <IDM root>/Languages folder, 
//then IDM uses default English files.
//Sample:
//tips=tips_de.txt
//help=idm_de.chm
//tutor=tut_de.chm

//Then you need to translate all IDM strings. 
//It's IMPORTANT when a string has any special characters 
//(%s %d %x %ld %I64d %% \r\n), they should all remain in the translated 
//string and cannot trade places. Remember that IDM inserts dynamic 
//values instead of these special characters in a predefined order. 
//Instead of %s IDM inserts a string, %% - %, in all other cases IDM 
//inserts a number.

//The strings beginning with // are comments 
//and you don't need to translate them

If IDM knows about necessary parameters for a given executable file name, it will set them automatically.

The scanned file among different parameters should be written as\r\n[File]\r\n(you should type square brackets as well). If no parameters are set, IDM will execute antiviral software appending the complete path of a downloaded file.
21191=Note that all modern antiviral software have \"real-time protection\" feature that checks all operations with files on your computer, and it includes all files downloaded in IDM. Thus, you need to add antiviral software scanner to IDM settings only when real-time protection is turned off in antiviral software settings.\r\nAlso, in some cases, real time protection may significantly slow down the assembly of files made by IDM.
